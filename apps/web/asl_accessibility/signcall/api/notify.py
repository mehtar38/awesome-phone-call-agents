"""
Tells the outside world what a run is doing, so a person can be told.

This is the "notification" to the user: when a run needs an answer, or has
finished, the server POSTs one JSON event to `SIGNCALL_NOTIFY_URL`. Today the
receiver is the web frontend, which shows it on screen; with real accounts it
would be replaced by a text message, an email or a push. Nothing else in the
workflow knows or cares which.

Events (all carry "event" and "run_id"):

    {"event": "confirmation_requested", "proposal": {...}}
    {"event": "run_finished", "status": "succeeded" | "declined" | "failed",
     "result": {...} | null, "error": str | null, "reason": str | null}

Delivery is best effort. A notifier that is down must never break a run, and
the same state is always available by polling GET /runs/{run_id}.
